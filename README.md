# SwiftVOTable
A simple VOTable parser written in Swift

Notes
-----

As of April 2015, Xcode 6.2 is still quite unstable about Swift (recurrent SourceKitService crashes). Hence
SwiftVOTable is being developed with Xcode 6.3-beta right now. This version has other problems (and the 'fix-it'
feature doesn't really help in every case).
