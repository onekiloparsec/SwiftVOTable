# SwiftVOTable

A simple [http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOTable/](VOTable) parser written in Swift.
VOTable is the XML data format used by astronomers worldwide, defined by the 
[http://www.ivoa.net](International Virtual Observatory Alliance).

Notes
-----

As of June 2015, this is developed with Swift 1.2 and Xcode 6.3.
This project is my first real work on Swift and as such, expect it to change in the coming months!
